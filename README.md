# MERN Handbook
This repository is a straightforward collection of notes, code examples, and exercises focused on full-stack web development with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It includes foundational topics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and expands to tools and concepts such as Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Redux/Toolkit, REST APIs, EJS, SQL (MySQL), middleware, error handling, database relationships, Git, terminal commands, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD. The content combines theory and practical examples, organized by topic for easy reference.

This is not a full course or production-ready code, but a comprehensive reference resource.
