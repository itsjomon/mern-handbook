# MERN Stack Learning Repository
> **ðŸŒŸ Star this repository if you find it useful!**

Welcome to my **MERN Stack** learning repository. This is a collection of notes, code examples, and problem-solving exercises created while learning full-stack web development with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

The repository covers the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with foundational topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and extends to tools and concepts including Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Redux/Toolkit, REST APIs, EJS, SQL (MySQL), middleware, error handling, database relationships, Git, GitHub, terminal commands, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD. It includes both theory and hands-on practice, organized topic-wise for easy reference.

This repository is not a full-fledged course or production-ready code. Instead, it's a collection of my personal notes, code snippets, and experiments created while learning web development and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
