# MERN Stack Learning Repository
> **ðŸŒŸ Star this repository if you find it useful!**

A growing collection focused on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and related web development technologies. It covers foundational topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and extends to tools and concepts including Tailwind, Bootstrap, Redux/Toolkit, REST APIs, EJS, SQL (MySQL), middleware, error handling, database relationships, Git, GitHub, terminal commands, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.

Includes mini projects, a full-stack app, and practice materials to reinforce learning. Not a structured course or production-ready code, just my organized notes and experiments on web development.

## Repository Structure
- Each topic is organized into separate `folders/files` for clarity.  
- Files are named to match their respective topics for easy identification.  
- Both notes and practical code examples are included for hands-on learning.
