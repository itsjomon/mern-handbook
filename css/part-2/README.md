## CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

- **Simple selectors (Select elements based on name, id, class)**

  - **Universal Selector** <br>
    To select everything in a document

    ```css
    * {
      property: value;
    }
    /* * is Universal Selector */
    ```

  - **Element Selector**

    ```css
    h1 {
      property: value;
    }
    /* h1 is Elemet Selector*/
    ```

  - **ID Selector** <br>
    Selects an element based on the value of the element's id attribute

    - It is case sensitive. eg: `#myid` & `#MYID` both are not same
      ```css
      #myid {
        property: value;
      }
      /* #myid is ID Selector*/
      ```

  - **Class Selector** <br>
    Selects an element based on their class attribute

    ```css
    .myclass {
      property: value;
    }
    /* .myclass is Class Selector*/
    ```

- **Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)**

  - **Descendant Selector (space)** <br>
    It is used to select elements that are descendants of a specified element.

    Eg - Selects all paragraphs inside divs

    ```css
    div p{
      property: value;
    }
    /* div p is Descendant Selector */
    ```

  - **Adjecent/Next Sibling Combinator (+)** <br>
    The adjacent sibling selector selects an element that is immediately next to a specified element.

    Eg - Heading3 that comes immediately after any paragraph

    ```css
    p + h3{
      property: value;
    }
    /* p + h3 is Sibling Combinator */
    ```

  - **child Combinator (>)** <br>
    The child combinator selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

    Eg - Selects all buttons which are direct children of spans
    ```css
    span > button{
      property: value;
    }
    /* span > button is Child Combinator */
    ```

- **Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)**

  - **Attribute Selector** <br>
    Eg - Selects elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute

    ```css
    input[attr="value"]{
      property: value;
    }
    ```

## Pseudo class
A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s)

```css
:hover
:active
:checked
:nth-of-type
```

## Pseudo Elements
A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s)

```css
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection
```

## Cascading

- **What is cascade in CSS?** <br>
  The `CSS cascade algorithm's` job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.

- **What is specificity?** <br>
  Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.

  ```css
  h2 {
      background-color: yellow;
  }
  h2 {
      background-color: blue;
  }

  /* final color is blue */
  ```

- **Cascading**: When multiple styles apply, the last one (in order) wins if specificity is equal.
- **Multiple CSS files**: The last linked file overrides earlier ones.
- **Specificity order**: `Inline > ID > Class > Tag`

## !important in CSS
To show the most specific thing in the document.

```css
h2 {
     background-color: "black !important";
   }
```

The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

## CSS Inheritance

- **Definition**: Inheritance means some CSS properties are automatically passed from a parent element to its children.
- **Common inherited properties**: `color`, `font-family`, `line-height`
- **Not all properties inherit**: Layout-related ones like `margin`, `padding`, `border` do not inherit by default.
- You can force inheritance using `inherit` keyword:  
  ```css
  p {
    border: inherit;
  }
  ```
